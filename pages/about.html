        <div style="padding:10px; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
            <p class="headers">The Interastral Peace Corporation (IPC) is a 
                multi-credillion corporation that is aimed at doing one thing:
                establishing Peace across the universe. Our founders, the Aeon
                of Preservation Qlipoth, Louis Fleming, and Dongfang Qixing, are 
                responsible for establishing the economy throughout the cosmos 
                as we know it today. Just about anywhere you'll find IPC-mandated
                tech, IPC carriers fulfill trades billions of times per day, and many
                planets are close partners and clients working with the IPC. As you
                might imagine, the functionality of the IPC is incredibly important
                to the planets and people of the vast cosmos. You too could 
                contribute to this.

            <p class="headers"><i>The IPC harvested all our natural resources, transformed our planet 
                into a top weapons manufacturing site, and provided employment 
                opportunities for millions of workers! Here on [Redacted] we have 
                never been prouder to support the military-industrial complex!

                Your lead debt collector recently saved us from a giant drill aimed 
                at our sun! It must have been created by some enraged cosmic force 
                because it was truly terrifying, but Topaz didn't break a sweat at 
                all! We are forever in debt to the IPC!
